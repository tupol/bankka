# Takkagotchi
 
Takkagotchi is a learning project based on [Akka Cluster], based on the [Tamagotchi] idea.

This *Takkagotchi* flavour game is very simple: 
- you get an egg 
- you get it to hatch
- the egg will hatch an *bing*, which is a sort of digital *being*
- you have to feed the *bing* at given intervals otherwise it will get hungry and starve
- you can tell the *bing* things that the *bing* will remember, otherwise the *bing* will get bored
- you can also say hello to your *bing* to chase the boredom away
- if the *bings* gets both hungry and bored it will turn to ashes, as in *"ashes to ashes..."* and that makes us sad
- the *bings* don't live forever, so they will eventually turn to ashes, which will make us sad, but we will always remember our *bing*

The learning exercise will try to model this in a sharded cluster fashion.
